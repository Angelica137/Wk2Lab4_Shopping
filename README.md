# Week 2 Lab4 - Shopping

## Exercise two

Create a Shopping project and add a Shopping class. You are required to store a collection of items (as Strings) that you need to buy at the shops. This is very similar to the Notebook project.

- Add a ArrayList class called shoppingList (a collection of Strings) as an attribute of the Shopping class.
- Add the following methods (as in Notebook):

  - constructor - so shoppingList references a new ArrayList object

  - addItem(String celeb) - to add an item to the shopping list

  - numberOfItems() - to return number of items on the list

  - showItem(int) - display item a given index

  - listItems() - display items in the shopping list

* Add some items to the shopping list and test the methods. Take a snapshot as evidence (along with your source code).
